# Source Code

Since GitHub doesn't provide large enough repositories for free to cover our whole Unity project, we zipped the latest working version and provide them as a release. So please check out the Releases here on GitHub and get the newest version of our Unity project from the latest release! Then check out the Installation guide in this repos readme on how to use the Unity Project!
